The currency of a country is as individualistic and unique a symbol of its economy as its national flag, which marks its independence and sovereignty. On account of the fact that different countries have their own geopolitical, religious and demographic background, the contours and nuances of their economy are likely to vary from one another, depending upon the needs, requirements, priorities and preferences of the government and people of those countries. For instance, a landlocked country with a sea nowhere around may not be in need of a Navy, at least not as big and powerful as that of seaborne nations. A small Navy may still be needed by a small country, as in the case of Switzerland, to perform tasks in its lakes and rivers. On the other hand, a country like China, which has hegemonic ambitions, has no pretensions about investing heavily on its defense outlay.

One cannot duck the question of the desirability or feasibility of having an ideal world economy where all global transactions are managed by a supranational currency in terms of expediency and transparency of the transactions rather than through a maze of several national currencies. Notwithstanding their peculiarities, the economies of nations are irrefutably interlinked and interdependent. Hence, this proposition of a world currency is worth considering and implementing. Realm is in a beta stage looking for solutions on how to make cryptocurrencies the only method of payment in the world.
